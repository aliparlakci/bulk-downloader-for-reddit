## [Download the latest release here](https://github.com/aliparlakci/bulk-downloader-for-reddit/releases/latest)

## üöÄ How to use
If you run **Windows**, after you extract the zip file, double-click on the *bulk-downloader-for-reddit.exe*. The program will guide you through. Also, take a look at the [Setting up the program](#üî®-setting-up-the-program) section. **However**, Bulk Dowloader for Reddit has a plenty of features which can only be activated via command line arguments. See [Options](#‚öô-Options) for it.

If you run **Linux**, there is a binary of the program which can be used through the Terminal. The program should still guide you through if you don't pass any arguments but you can also use [Options](#‚öô-Options).

Unfortunately, there is no binary for **MacOS**. If you are a MacOS user, you must use the program from the source code. See the [Interpret from source code](docs/INTERPRET_FROM_SOURCE.md) page.

OR, regardless of your operating system, you can fire up the program from the **source code**. See the [Interpret from source code](docs/INTERPRET_FROM_SOURCE.md) page.

## üî® Setting up the program
### üñº IMGUR API

You need to create an imgur developer app in order API to work. Go to https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient and login.

IMGUR will redirect you to homepage instead of API form page. After you log in, open the above link manually. Fill the form in the link (It does not really matter what you fill it with. You can write www.google.com to the callback url)

After you send the form, it will redirect you to a page where it shows your **imgur_client_id** and **imgur_client_secret**. Type in those values into program respectively.

### üìΩ ffmpeg Library
  
Program uses ffmpeg software to add audio to some video files. However, you are **not** required to install it. Although the program can still run with no errors without the ffmpeg library, some video files might have no sound.
  
[Download ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) manually on your system and [add the bin folder in the downloaded folder's directory to `PATH` of your system.](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)

OR install it through a package manager such as **Chocolatey** in Windows, **apt** in Linux or **Homebrew** in MacOS:

- **in Windows**: After you **[install Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)**, type **`choco install ffmpeg`** in either Command Promt or Powershell.
- **in Linux**: Type **`sudo apt install ffmpeg`** in Terminal.
- **in MacOS**: After you **[install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)**, type **`brew install ffmpeg`** in Terminal

## ‚öô Options

Some of the below features are available only through command-line.

## ‚ùî FAQ

### I am running the script on a headless machine or on a remote server. How can I authenticate my reddit account?
- Download the script on your everday computer and run it for once.
- Authenticate the program on both reddit and imgur.
- Go to your Home folder (for Windows users it is `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\`, for Linux users it is `/home/[USERNAME]`)
- Copy the *config.json* file inside the Bulk Downloader for Reddit folder and paste it **next to** the file that you run the program.

### How can I change my credentials?
- All of the user data is held in **config.json** file which is in a folder named "Bulk Downloader for Reddit" in your **Home** directory. You can edit them, there.  

  Also if you already have a config.json file, you can paste it **next to** the script and override the one on your Home directory. 

### What do the dots resemble when getting posts?
- Each dot means that 100 posts are scanned.

### Getting posts takes too long.
- You can press *Ctrl+C* to interrupt it and start downloading.

### How do I open self post files?
- Self posts are held at reddit as styled with markdown. So, the script downloads them as they are in order not to lose their stylings.
  However, there is a [great Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk) for viewing Markdown files with its styling. Install it and open the files with [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/tr/chrome/).  

  However, they are basically text files. You can also view them with any text editor such as Notepad on Windows, gedit on Linux or Text Editor on MacOS.
