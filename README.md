## Requirements
- Python 3.x*

You can install Python 3 here: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  

You have to check "**Add Python 3 to PATH**" option when installing in order it to run correctly.

*\*:Although the latest version of python is suggested, you can use 3.6.5 since it runs perfectly on that version*

---

## Configuring the APIs
Because this is not a commercial app, you need to create yourself a reddit and an imgur developer app in order APIs to work.

### Creating a reddit app
* Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
* Under **developer apps**, click on **create another app**
* Enter a name into the **name** field.
* Select **script**
* In **redirect uri** field, enter your reddit profile URL.
* Click **create app** button  

Your **reddit_client_id** is on the right of the app's icon. And your **reddit_client_secret** is under that.

### Creating an imgur app
* Go to https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient
* Enter a name into the **Application Name** field.
* Pick **Anonymous usage without user authorization** as an **Authorization type**
* Enter your email into the Email field.
* Correct CHAPTCHA
* Click **submit** button  

It should redirect to a page which shows your **imgur_client_id** and **imgur_client_secret**

## Program Modes
All the program modes are activated with command-line arguments as shown [here](#using-the-command-line-arguments)  
### saved mode
In saved mode, the program gets posts from given user's saved posts.
### submitted mode
In submitted mode, the program gets posts from given user's submitted posts.
### subreddit mode
In subreddit mode, the program gets posts from given subreddits* that is sorted by given type and limited by given number.  

Multiple subreddits can be given

*You may also use search in this mode. See [`python3 script.py --help`](#using-the-command-line-arguments).*
### multireddit mode
In multireddit mode, the program gets posts from given user's given multireddit that is sorted by given type and limited by given number.  
### link mode
In link mode, the program gets posts from given reddit link.  

You may customize the behaviour with `--sort`, `--time`, `--limit`.

*You may also use search in this mode. See [`python3 script.py --help`](#using-the-command-line-arguments).*

### log read mode
Two log files are created each time *script.py* runs.
- **POSTS** Saves all the posts without filtering.
- **FAILED** Keeps track of posts that are tried to be downloaded but failed.

In log mode, the program takes a log file which created by itself, reads posts and tries downloading them again.

Running log read mode for FAILED.json file once after the download is complete is **HIGHLY** recommended as unexpected problems may occur.

---

## Running the script
**IMPORTANT** You *MUST* be in the directory where script.py is located when running. Otherwise the program will not run correctly.  

**WARNING** *DO NOT* let more than *1* instance of script run as it interferes with IMGUR Request Rate.  

### Starting for the first time
**WARNING** When running the script for the first time, it will prompt you to enter your credentials into the *command line* where they might be stored. In order to prevent such behaviour, create a **config.json** file as shown below and enter your credentials inside **double quotes**:  
```json
{
    "reddit_username": "",
    "reddit_password": "",
    "reddit_client_id": "",
    "reddit_client_secret": "",
    "imgur_client_id": "",
    "imgur_client_secret": ""
}
```

### Using the command line arguments

Open up the [terminal](https://www.reddit.com/r/NSFW411/comments/8vtnl8/meta_i_made_reddit_downloader_that_can_download/e1rnbnl) and navigate to where script.py is. If you are unfamiliar with changing directories in terminal see Change Directories in [this article](https://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything).

Run the script.py file from terminal with command-line arguments. Here is the help page:  

**ATTENTION** Use `.\` for current directory and `..\` for upper directory when using short directories, otherwise it might act weird.
